## 1. Brevity is Key

Attention spans are short, and so should your component names be. Modern tools like Copilot or Cursor can autocomplete the rest — so why waste characters?

Need a navbar? Call it `nv`. A reusable card? Try `c`. It’s lean, mean, and incomprehensible — just like your startup’s business plan. And the best part? No one will dare refactor your code because no one can find it. That’s modern job security.

## 2. Rank High in Search

In the era of AI pair programming, visibility is everything. You’re not just naming a component — you’re optimizing for discoverability by humans, LLMs, and whatever runs `grep` at 3 a.m.

So forget “LoginForm” and go with `LoginFormAuthFirebaseSupabaseSSO2025`. Is it overkill? Maybe. Will it show up in every search ever? Definitely.

## 3. Mix Languages

Your team is global, your product is global — your component names should be too. It’s 2025, and if your repo doesn’t have at least three languages and one emoji in the component tree, are you even agile?

Label your toast notifications `PainGrillé`, your buttons `ボタン`, and sprinkle in a few Klingon classnames while you’re at it. It’s inclusive, educational, and guaranteed to confuse the next developer so badly that you’ll become the default expert.
