## 1. AI Assisted Development

Since the release of GitHub Copilot and the rise of AI-native IDEs like Cursor and Codeium, the development workflow has become more conversational than mechanical. Today’s tools don’t just autocomplete code — they propose architectures, write tests, and review your PRs before your manager does.

In 2025, we’re seeing AI tooling become an essential part of the development stack. These assistants now understand context across files, suggest performance improvements, and can even predict bugs before you write them.

We predict the average dev will spend more time refining AI-generated code than writing from scratch. And yes, Stack Overflow traffic continues to drop as developers Google less and prompt more.

## 2. Rendering Patterns

Static or server-rendered? In 2025, it's neither — or both. Frameworks like Next.js, Qwik, and Astro now offer hybrid rendering out of the box, adapting strategies in real time based on device, location, or user behavior.

Today’s front-end devs don’t just think about hydration — they think about **partial pre-rendering**, **islands architecture**, and **per-request interactivity**. And yes, we’re still pretending that hydration boundaries make intuitive sense.

This year, expect more tools that abstract rendering decisions entirely, plus a new job title: *Edge Performance Strategist*.

## 3. JS Runtimes

The JavaScript runtime ecosystem has continued its rapid evolution. Bun is winning benchmarks. Deno is quietly powering secure edge infra. And Node... well, it still runs your team's legacy scripts from 2018.

In 2025, cross-runtime compatibility is improving, but choice still matters. Bun’s native tooling has made it a go-to for performance-focused teams, while Deno’s Web Standard alignment gives it an edge in secure environments.

We expect to see even more niche runtimes this year — including one that claims to execute middleware *before requests happen*. Time to First Byte? Try Time to First Thought.
