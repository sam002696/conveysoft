## Overview

Merchly embarked on an ambitious mission: to give creators a polished, user‑friendly storefront for their own line of custom merch—without needing technical know‑how. They approached us to build an integrated platform where creators could design products, set prices, manage stock, and process payments—all in one place.

## Challenge

- Support for variable products (e.g., T‑shirts in multiple sizes/colors) with real-time inventory.
- Frictionless checkout flow, including guest checkout and saved cards.
- Admin dashboard for creators to manage orders, track sales, and view analytics.
- Reliable hosting and scalability to handle flash‑sale traffic spikes.
