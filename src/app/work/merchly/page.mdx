## Overview

A scalable, role-based e-commerce application developed for efficient product and order management, featuring distinct experiences for both admins and customers. It leverages modern frontend frameworks and robust backend architecture to ensure performance, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

## Challenge

- Real-time order tracking and toast-based customer notifications.
- Admin-facing dashboard to manage products, images, categories, sizes, and brands.
- Optimistic UI updates for smoother UX during cart and order interactions.
- Scalable deployment using AWS, Docker, and Laravel’s event-driven backend.
