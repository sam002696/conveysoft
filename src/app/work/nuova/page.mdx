## Overview

Nuova set out to modernize the property management experience through a single, streamlined system. The vision: create tailored digital portals for each role—property managers, landlords, tenants, contractors, and admins—each offering the exact tools they need to work efficiently, communicate clearly, and stay in sync.

## Challenge

- Build five unique portals with role-based access control and dynamic routing.
- Implement authentication for both dashboard and real-time chat environments.
- Allow for complete property oversight, job tracking, and maintenance updates in one place.
- Enable secure communication and file sharing between all stakeholders.
- Deploy a full-stack system that’s modular, real-time, and easy to maintain.
