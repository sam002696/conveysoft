## Overview

ArisPay set out to create a secure, user-friendly crypto wallet supporting multichain and testnet operations. The aim was to provide users with a full view of their assets—along with fast, secure actions like transfers, swaps, and purchases—without sacrificing performance or control.

## Challenge

- Non-custodial authentication using mnemonic phrase recovery.
- Multi-network support (Ethereum, testnets, and others) with real-time sync.
- Complete transaction tracking and on-chain history visibility.
- Intuitive and modular UI with performance-optimized components.
- Reliable integration with third-party APIs (e.g., Infura, Laravel backend).
